    <h2>Prefered name: Erik</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Charles Erik Burton. I go by my middle name, "Erik".</p>
    <p>I am working to complete a Bachelors degree in Software Developement. I orignally started my career
        as a Purchasing Manager for some manufacturing companines in Southern California and in Utah. I did't 
        find enjoyment in that career path and decided to make a change.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am married and have 3 adult children and 3 grandsons. It's great being a Grandpa. 
    </p>
    <p>Currently I am a QA Software Engineer and have been for the last 10 years. I tried to earn my degree in
       Software Developement before, but due to "life", I wasn't successful at the time. However,
       this time is a fresh start and I will feel a great sense of accomplishment on this 3rd time. As it's often said, "The third
       times a charm."
    </p>
    <p>I play the drums when I'm not working or doing school work. I have played the drums for over 40 years. Drumming keeps me on
       my toes as I continue to always try to learn new things. After 40 years of playing, I still don't know it all. I also like 
       cars and attend car shows throughout the year where I live in Florida. My favorite car is the Chevy Camaro. I have owned a
       few over the years.
    </p>
    <p>I am looking forward to learning more from this class and meeting everyone.</p>
