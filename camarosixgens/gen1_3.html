    <h2>First Generation 1967-1969</h2>
    <p>The first-generation Camaro was made to compete with the Ford Mustang, which was sold by Ford in 1965. 
      The Mustang was taking the world by storm and Chevrolet needed its own answer to compete with the Mustang 
      and blow its doors off in sales and in racing. The most popular racing for the “Pony” car was known as 
      Trans-Am Series, which is based on production race cars running on road courses with a focus on American 
      muscle cars like the Ford Mustang, Dodge Challenger & Mercury Cougar. The American car manufactures wanted to 
      “Win on Sunday, Sell on Monday”. Meaning wins on the racetrack would help generate sales in the show room. 
      The Camaro came in a few different models, the coupe, Rally Sport and Super Sport. The coupe came with an 
      inline 6-cylinder engine and a V8, 8-cylinder engine. Super Sports came with the larger V8 engines and upgraded 
      suspension. These were made to go fast and outrun the competition. The hidden gem was a 302 cubic inch V8 
      option engine specifically made for the Trans-Am Series. This option was simply known as option Z28. Only the 
      Z28 was offered the high revving, high horsepower engine and special suspension. The Z28 had special 
      racing stripes on the hood and trunk.

    <h2>Second Generation 1970-1981</h2>
    <p>The first generation sold plenty of units, but Chevrolet was ready to keep up with the Jones (other manufactures 
      and decided it was time for a facelift. The second-generation Camaro was a little bit longer the its predecessor and 
      was pointier in the front and round in the back. It was designed to look sleek and fast, but was much heavier than 
      before. Again, the Z28, Rally Sport and Super Sport options were available to purchase. But in the early 70’s the gas 
      crunch came and emissions to curb pollution were on everyone’s mind. Thus, the car manufactures needed to reduce 
      horsepower and come up with engines that would save gas and give out less pollution. Chevrolet and the competition 
      dumbed down the engines and performance of its muscle cars, but the Camaro was a fan favorite and sales still soared.

  <div id="third-gen">
    <img class="gen3-image" src="images/newgen3.jpg" alt="1985 IROC Camaro">
    <h2>Thrid Generation 1982-1992</h2>
    <p>The second-generation lasted 11 years before the Camaro was ready for another facelift. With less horsepower and emissions 
      now a constant, the look of the Third Generation was starting to lean to comfort and less racing. The third-gen brings back 
      the squared look of Gen 1. The models now available were the Sport Coupe, Berlinetta (comfort) and a much weaker Z28. 
      That was until the 1985 model year which introduced a new model to the public, the IROC. IROC stands for International Race of Champions. 
      This car in red, looked lean and mean. While still a mild powered car from generations earlier, this car was ready to hit the track. 
      It featured Chevy’s all new TPI option (Tuned Port Injection). The IROC was a great looking car.
