    <div id="fourth-gen">
      <h2>Fourth Generation 1993-2002</h2>
      <p>Time again for another facelift by Chevy and once again the engineering team went with a pointier front 
        and a round rear end. Thought to cut through the wind and have down force created by the round one-piece 
        rear window to keep the car on the track for the racing folks. Power was starting to make a comeback and 
        more powerful V8 engines were now being offered. The Z28 and Super Sport are still being offered by Chevrolet. 
        In addition to a 35th Anniversary model SS for the 2002 year.

    <div id="fifth-gen">
      <h2>Fifth Generation 2010-2015</h2>
      <p>After an 8-year hiatus, Chevrolet reintroduced the legendary muscle car to the market with popular models such as 
      the SS and the ZL1. These models featured powerful V8 engines, aggressive styling, and performance upgrades like Brembo 
      brakes and magnetic ride control, catering to enthusiasts seeking top-tier performance. With the help of the popular 
      Transformers movie, the iconic character “Bumble-Bee” was brought to life with the 2010 Camaro.

    <div id="sixth-gen">
      <h2>Sixth Generation 2016-2024</h2>
      <p>To keep up with the ever-changing Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger and Challenger, Camaro got a new sleek and 
        aerodynamic design. Models like the SS (Super Sport) ZL1 and its highly desired track model, the 1LE (Limited Edition) 
        gave the buyers incredible driving experience. If you craved raw power, keep you in your seat speed or stick to the 
        road handling, Camaro offered it. Unfortunately for the Camaro the end of the line comes in the 2024 year. Poor sales, 
        better performance and the all-new electric cars has killed off the desire for speed and power. Life is ever changing 
        and the Camaro couldn’t keep up.
