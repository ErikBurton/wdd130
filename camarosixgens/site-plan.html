        The Camaro first began production in late 1966 and was sold on the market in 1967. 1967 - 2024 is a 57-year run for the Camaro. Not including a 
        brief period where production stopped from 2003-2010. In all a total of 50 years the Chevy Camaro was sold around the globe to those who admired style 
        and speed. This website is going to cover the six generations of Camaros and identify the most popular models made over the last 57 years. 
        The Corvette and Mustang are just a handful of American car models that have been in production more than 50 years.

      </ul>
      <h3>Generations 1-3</h3>
      <p>First Generation: 1967 - 1969
        The first-generation Camaro was made to compete with the Ford Mustang, which was sold by Ford in 1965. The Mustang was taking the world by storm and Chevrolet needed its own answer to compete with the Mustang and blow its doors off in sales and in racing.
        The most popular racing for the “Pony” car was known as Trans-Am Series, which is based on production race cars running on road courses with a focus on American muscle cars like the Ford Mustang, Dodge Challenger & Mercury Cougar. The American car manufactures wanted to “Win on Sunday, Sell on Monday”. Meaning wins on the racetrack would help generate sales in the show room. 
        The Camaro came in a few different models, the coupe, Rally Sport and Super Sport. The coupe came with an inline 6-cylinder engine and a V8, 8-cylinder engine. Super Sports came with the larger V8 engines and upgraded suspension. These were made to go fast and outrun the competition.  The hidden gem was a 302 cubic inch V8 option engine specifically made for the Trans-Am Series. This option was simply known as option Z28. Only the Z28 was offered the high revving, high horsepower engine and special suspension. The Z28 had special racing stripes on the hood and trunk. 
      </p>
      <p>Second Generation: 1970 - 1981
	      The first generation sold plenty of units, but Chevrolet was ready to keep up with the Jones (other manufactures and decided it was time for a facelift. The second-generation Camaro was a little bit longer the its predecessor and was pointier in the front and round in the back. It was designed to look sleek and fast, but was much heavier than before. Again, the Z28, Rally Sport and Super Sport options were available to purchase. But in the early 70’s the gas crunch came and emissions to curb pollution were on everyone’s mind. Thus, the car manufactures needed to reduce horsepower and come up with engines that would save gas and give out less pollution. Chevrolet and the competition dumbed down the engines and performance of its muscle cars, but the Camaro was a fan favorite and sales still soared.  
      </p>
      <p>Third Generation: 1982-1992
	      The second-generation lasted 11 years before the Camaro was ready for another facelift. With less horsepower and emissions now a constant, the look of the Third Generation was starting to lean to comfort and less racing. The third-gen brings back the squared look of Gen 1. The models now available were the Sport Coupe, Berlinetta (comfort) and a much weaker Z28. That was until the 1985 model year which introduced a new model to the public, the IROC. IROC stands for International Race of Champions. This car in red, looked lean and mean. While still a mild powered car from generations earlier, this car was ready to hit the track. It featured Chevy’s all new TPI option (Tuned Port Injection). The IROC was a great looking car.

      </ul>
      <h3>Generations 4-6</h3>
      <p>Fourth Generation: 1993 - 2002
	Time again for another facelift by Chevy and once again the engineering team went with a pointier front and a round rear end. Thought to cut through the wind and have down force created by the round one-piece rear window to keep the car on the track for the racing folks. Power was starting to make a comeback and more powerful V8 engines were now being offered. The Z28 and Super Sport are still being offered by Chevrolet. In addition to a 35th Anniversary model SS for the 2002 year.</p>
        <p>Fifth Generation: 2010 - 2015
          After an 8-year hiatus, Chevrolet reintroduced the legendary muscle car to the market with popular models such as the SS and the ZL1. These models featured powerful V8 engines, aggressive styling, and performance upgrades like Brembo brakes and magnetic ride control, catering to enthusiasts seeking top-tier performance. With the help of the popular Transformers movie, the iconic character “Bumble-Bee” was brought to life with the 2010 Camaro.
        </p>
        <p>Sixth Generation: 2016-2024
          To keep up with the ever-changing Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger and Challenger, Camaro got a new sleek and aerodynamic design. Models like the SS (Super Sport) ZL1 and its highly desired track model, the 1LE (Limited Edition) gave the buyers incredible driving experience. If you craved raw power, keep you in your seat speed or stick to the road handling, Camaro offered it.  Unfortunately for the Camaro the end of the line comes in the 2024 year. Poor sales, better performance and the all-new electric cars has killed off the desire for speed and power. Life is ever changing and the Camaro couldn’t keep up.
